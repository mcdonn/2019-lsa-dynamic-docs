# Dynamic documents

- "Dynamic documents" was coined by Yihui Xie for the R package `knitr` based on earlier versions of `Sweave`
- `knitr` allows us to create documents in various formats (e.g., LaTeX, Markdown) with various outputs (HTML slides, `Shiny` apps, PDF documents), all of which combines Markup and executable code.

- In the breakout section, we'll primarily work with **R Markdown**, an *R-flavor* of traditional Markdown.

# Benefits & drawbacks of RMarkdown


.pull-left[
- It's simple
- It's portable
- Produces reproducible documents
- Outputs to various static and dynamic formats
- ...
]

.pull-right[
- Few native formatting options
  - e.g., interlinear glossed examples not straightforward (unless use LaTeX and knitr)
- Yet another flavor of Markdown
- Not widely used in linguistics
- ...

# Breaking down the components of a dynamic document with RMarkdown

Dynamic documents are composed of: 

1. YAML header
2. R code chunks
3. Text

---

# YAML header
The YAML header contains... 
  1. **metadata**
    - author
    - title 
    - date
  1. **output formats**
    - HTML
    - Markdown
    - PDF
    - Word
    
Here's a basic example...

```yaml
---
title: "A basic example"
author: "Bradley McDonnell and Bradley Rentz"
date: "12/29/2018"
output: html_document
---
```

---

# YAML header

The YAML header can be quite complicated.
- The `output` can contain a number of options (which can be quite helpful!).

# Code chunks

- Code chunks contain the R code that we want to execute.

````md
The plot below shows a slight increase in intensity in the final syllable of the word. 

`r ''````{r boxplot, echo=TRUE, comment="#", message=FALSE, fig.height=6}

library(tidyverse)

# Loading the dataframe
pse_stress <- read_tsv("data/pse-stress-simplified.csv") %>% 
                          mutate(Word = fct_recode(Word),
                                Position = fct_recode(Position),
                                Vowel = fct_recode(Vowel),
                                Weight = fct_recode(Weight),
                                Focus = fct_recode(Focus),
                                Final = fct_recode(Final)
                                )
                                      
# A simple boxplot of intensity

# Anatomy of a code chunk

- Code chunks are marked by ` ``` ` at the start and end of the chunk.
- Followed by the specification of the programming language, 
  - `r` or `{r}` in our case
  - Optionally followed by a name for the code chunk, and
  - many options for how the code chunk is treated. 
- Finally, the code itself!


````markdown
`r ''````{r boxplot, echo=FALSE, comment="#", message=FALSE, fig.height=6}

# A simple boxplot of intensity
int <- ggplot(pse_stress, aes(Position, Intensity))
int + geom_boxplot()

```
````

**Note it's also possible to set Global Options that apply to all code chunks.**

````markdown
`r ''````{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE)
```
````

---

# Inline code

- You can also embed code directly in the text itself.
- Just use ` ` followed by the langauge name, then the code and a final ` `

````markdown
``r ''  `r 4*6`
````
- For example 4*6 = `r 4*6` or $\sqrt{2}$ = `r sqrt(2)`

---

# Tables

- Making simple tables is easy in Rmarkdown
- Knitr has table function `kable`
- Select the data you want from a dataframe and then display it as a table

```{r kable}
pse_stress %>% select(Word, Position, Vowel, Duration) %>%
head() %>% knitr::kable(format="html")
```

---

# Tables for regression models

- The R package `sjPlot` can create summary tables for regression models including mixed effect models

```{r sjplot1, warning=F}
stress.lm <- lm(Duration*1000 ~ Position, data = pse_stress)
sjPlot::tab_model(stress.lm)
```

---

# Mixed effect model table Example

```{r sjplot2, warning=F}
stress.lmer <- lmerTest::lmer(Duration*1000 ~ Position +
(1|Participant), data = pse_stress)
sjPlot::tab_model(stress.lmer)
```

---

# Text

- The document's text would be written in RMarkdown or LaTeX
- It's possible to mix in HTML formatting
  - and/or LaTeX code in with R Markdown

---

# Formatting text

- RMarkdown text formatting is similar to Markdown
- *Italics*, **Bold**, ~~strikethrough~~, Superscript^2^
- LaTeX math equations: $A = \pi*r^{2}$
