# Dynamic documents

- "Dynamic documents" was coined by Yihui Xie for the R package `knitr` based on earlier versions of `Sweave`
- `knitr` allows us to create documents in various formats (e.g., LateX, Markdown) with various outputs (HTML slides, `Shiny` apps, PDF documents), all of which combines Markup and executable code.

- In the breakout section, we'll primarily work with **R Markdown**, an *R-flavor* of traditional Markdown.

# Benefits & drawbacks of RMarkdown


.pull-left[
- It's simple
- It's portable
- Produces reproducible documents
- Outputs to various static and dynamic formats
- ...
]

.pull-right[
- Few native formatting options
  - e.g., interlinear glossed examples not straightforward
- Yet another flavor of Markdown
- Not widely used in linguistics
- ...

# Breaking down the components of a dynamic document with RMarkdown

Dynamic documents are composed of: 

1. YAML header
2. R code chunks
3. Text

---

# YAML header
The YAML header contains... 
  1. **metadata**
    - author
    - title 
    - date
  1. **output formats**
    - HTML
    - Markdown
    - PDF
    - Word
    
Here's a basic example...

```yaml
---
title: "A basic example"
author: "Bradley McDonnell"
date: "12/29/2018"
output: html_document
---
```

---

# YAML header

The YAML header can be quite complicated.
- The `output` can contain a number of options (which can be quite helpful!).

# Code chunks

- Code chunks contain the R code that we want to execute.

````md

# Anatomy of a code chunk

- Code chunks are marked by ` ``` ` at the start and end of the chunk.
- Followed by the specification of the programming language, 
  - `r` or `{r}` in our case
  - Optionally followed by a name for the code chunk, and
  - many options for how the code chunk is treated. 
- Finally, the code itself!


````markdown
`r ''````{r boxplot, echo=FALSE, comment="#", message=FALSE, fig.height=6}

# A simple boxplot of intensity
int <- ggplot(pse_stress, aes(Position, Intensity))
int + geom_boxplot()

```
````

**Note it's also possible to set Global Options that apply to all code chunks.**

````markdown
`r ''````{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE)
```
````

# Text

- The text would ideally be R Markdown...
  - but it's possible to also use LaTeX
- Or it's possible to mix in HTML formatting
  - and/or LaTeX code in with R Markdown
