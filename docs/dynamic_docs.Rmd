# What is Reproducible Research?

"[...] *reproducibility* [...] in research means that the data on which publications are based are made available so that other scientists could ostensibly verify the results for themselves."

`r Citep(rrBib, "gawne2019reflections", after=": 21")`

"The idea [of reproducible research] is the final product of research is not only the paper itself, but also the full computational environment used to produce the results in the paper such as the code and data necessary for reproduction of the results..."


`r TextCite(rrBib, "xie2015dynamic", after=": 5")`
in discussion of `r TextCite(rrBib, "fomel2009guest")`

.footnote[
**Note:** *Reproducibility* differs from *replicability*, "in which the steps of a research project are replicated by another scientist, yielding new data which can confirm or contradict previous data" `r Citep(rrBib, "gawne2019reflections", after=": 21")`.

\*For many types of linguistic research, *replication* is simply not possible.

# What are some reasons for practicing reproducible research?


???

- For science to be trustworthy
- Allows us to confirm previous analyses
- Allows us to build upon others' analyses 
- Decreases the chances of copy/paste errors
- Allows us to focus more time on the research and not tedious tasks


---

# Tools

Reproducible research is increasingly possible with the proliferation of tools.

<img src="https://git-scm.com/images/logos/downloads/Git-Logo-2Color.png" style="width: 15%" align="right"/>
- git allows us to keep track of the changes we make to code, data, etc. 


- GitHub allows us<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Octicons-mark-github.svg/200px-Octicons-mark-github.svg.png" style="width: 15%" align="right"/>  
  - to keep track of these changes while collaborating with others,
  - share research with others 

  
- RStudio and Jyputer notebooks allow us weave together code, code output, visulization, data, analysis, and documentation.

# Dynamic documents

- "Dynamic documents" was coined by Yihui Xie for the R package `knitr` based on earlier versions of `Sweave`
- `knitr` allows us to create documents in various formats (e.g., LaTeX, Markdown) with various outputs (HTML slides, `Shiny` apps, PDF documents), all of which combines Markup and executable code.

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/61d189fd9cdf955058415d3e1b28dd60e1bd7c9b/b739c/lesson-images/rmarkdownflow.png)

- In the breakout section, we'll primarily work with **R Markdown**, an *R-flavor* of traditional Markdown.

# Benefits & drawbacks of RMarkdown


.pull-left[
- It's simple
- It's portable
- Produces reproducible documents
- Outputs to various static and dynamic formats
- ...
]

.pull-right[
- Few native formatting options
  - e.g., interlinear glossed examples not straightforward (unless use LaTeX and knitr)
- Yet another flavor of Markdown
- Not widely used in linguistics
- ...

# Breaking down the components of a dynamic document with RMarkdown

Dynamic documents are composed of: 

1. YAML header
2. R code chunks
3. Text

---

# YAML header
The YAML header contains... 
  1. **metadata**
    - author
    - title 
    - date
  1. **output formats**
    - HTML
    - Markdown
    - PDF
    - Word
    
Here's a basic example...

```yaml
---
title: "A basic example"
author: "Bradley McDonnell and Bradley Rentz"
date: "12/29/2018"
output: html_document
---
```

---

# YAML header

The YAML header can be quite complicated.
- The `output` can contain a number of options (which can be quite helpful!).

# Code chunks

- Code chunks contain the R code that we want to execute.

````md
The plot below shows a slight increase in intensity in the final syllable of the word. 

`r ''````{r boxplot, echo=TRUE, comment="#", message=FALSE, fig.height=6}

library(tidyverse)

# Loading the dataframe
pse_stress <- read_tsv("data/pse-stress-simplified.csv") %>% 
                          mutate(Word = fct_recode(Word),
                                Position = fct_recode(Position),
                                Vowel = fct_recode(Vowel),
                                Weight = fct_recode(Weight),
                                Focus = fct_recode(Focus),
                                Final = fct_recode(Final)
                                )
                                      
# A simple boxplot of intensity

# Anatomy of a code chunk

- Code chunks are marked by ` ``` ` at the start and end of the chunk.
- Followed by the specification of the programming language, 
  - `r` or `{r}` in our case
  - Optionally followed by a name for the code chunk, and
  - many options for how the code chunk is treated. 
- Finally, the code itself!


````markdown
`r ''````{r boxplot, echo=FALSE, comment="#", message=FALSE, fig.height=6}

# A simple boxplot of intensity
int <- ggplot(pse_stress, aes(Position, Intensity))
int + geom_boxplot()

```
````

**Note it's also possible to set Global Options that apply to all code chunks.**

````markdown
`r ''````{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE)
```
````

---

# Inline code

- You can also embed code directly in the text itself.
- Just use ` ` followed by the langauge name, then the code and a final ` `

````markdown
``r ''  `r 4*6`
````
- For example 4*6 = `r 4*6` or $\sqrt{2}$ = `r sqrt(2)`

---

# Tables

- Making simple tables is easy in Rmarkdown
- Knitr has table function `kable`
- Select the data you want from a dataframe and then display it as a table

```{r kable}
pse_stress %>% select(Word, Position, Vowel, Duration) %>%
head() %>% knitr::kable(format="html")
```

---

# Tables for regression models

- The R package `sjPlot` can create summary tables for regression models including mixed effect models

```{r sjplot1, warning=F}
stress.lm <- lm(Duration*1000 ~ Position, data = pse_stress)
sjPlot::tab_model(stress.lm)
```

---

# Mixed effect model table Example

```{r sjplot2, warning=F}
stress.lmer <- lmerTest::lmer(Duration*1000 ~ Position +
(1|Participant), data = pse_stress)
sjPlot::tab_model(stress.lmer)
```

---

# Text

- The document's text would be written in R Markdown or LaTeX
- It's possible to mix in HTML formatting
  - and/or LaTeX code in with R Markdown

---

# Formatting text

- R Markdown text formatting is similar to Markdown
- *Italics*, **Bold**, and ~~strikethrough~~
- LaTeX math equations: $A = \pi*r^{2}$
- [link text](http://www.ling.hawaii.edu)

```yaml
- *Italics*, **Bold**, and ~~strikethrough~~
- LaTeX math equations: $A = \pi*r^{2}$
- [link text](http://www.ling.hawaii.edu)

# Interactive map example
